## 1. Initializing files
1. Setup backend
```
npx express-generator
npm start
```
- go to `localhost:3000` to see if express works!

2. Setup front using react 
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

3. Running initial files
- make sure to npm install if `MODULE NOT FOUND`

4. Import importthis.sql in root folder onto mySQL schema

### Issues
backend npm start didnt run at first
- tried to npm install: still doesnt show any output
- test.js file shows that its working though

todo: set up backend servers to take in login information and CRUD with SQL database


## Front End Design
Idea is to start from the product page. Then add cart logic and then login part. Start with the look then add the logic to connect to backend
