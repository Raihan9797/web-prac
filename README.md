## 1. Initializing files
1. Setup backend
```
npx express-generator
npm start
```
- go to `localhost:3000` to see if express works!

2. Setup front using react 
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

3. Running initial files
- make sure to npm install if `MODULE NOT FOUND`

### Issues
backend npm start didnt run at first
- tried to npm install: still doesnt show any output
- test.js file shows that its working though
